# Virus using Turtle lib

The title is surely a misnomer :)<br>
This pyscript generates a visual animation which ends up drawing an entity similar to a biological virus.

The only requirement for this file to work is the `turtle` library.

It can be installed using the command:
`pip install turtle`<br><br>

Execution output:<br>
<img src="virus-sim.png" width=40%>
