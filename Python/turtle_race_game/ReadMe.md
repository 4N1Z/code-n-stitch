# Turtle Library
I’m sure everybody has used a drawing board as a kid. Now, imagine, instead of manually drawing on the board, you could command the system to draw for you. Isn’t that cool? Python’s turtle module lets you do that. It basically lets you create a drawing board and command a turtle to draw for you.

# The game
Here we have a classic race game between two turtles.

# How to play?
All you need to do is press 'Enter'
  1. The screen prompts : Player 1 press enter to roll the die
        (as player 1 presses enter, the die rolls and turtle 1 moves the number of spaces rolled by the die.)
        
  2. The screen prompts : Player 2 press enter to roll the die
        (as player 2 presses enter, the die rolls and turtle 2 moves the number of spaces rolled by the die.)
        
        
 This goes on until a player crosses the finish line.
 As one of the players crosses the finish line, the player wins and the game ends.
