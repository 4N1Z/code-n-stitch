# PyMailer | [Issue #4](https://github.com/bislara/code-n-stitch/issues/4)

PyMailer is an open source GUI application written in python using PySide2 and smtplib. 

## How to Use?

1. `cd` to the directory where the files are present.

2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements.

3. Execute the script by running the following command.

```bash
python main.py
```

4. Enter the rquired credentials in the given fields.

5. Follow the on screen instructions :)


## Quick Note 

If you are using smtp server of gmail, I would advise you to use `App Passwords` instead of using your normal passwords, it is because, if you do use your normal password, you will need to enable `Less Secure Apps` and maybe use `Display Unlock Captcha`, but by using `App Password` you won't need to do anything.
