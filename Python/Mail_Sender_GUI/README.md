## Quick Note 

If you are using smtp server of gmail, I would advise you to use `App Passwords` instead of using your normal passwords, it is because, if you do use your normal password, you will need to enable `Less Secure Apps` and maybe use `Display Unlock Captcha`, but by using `App Password` you won't need to do anything.
