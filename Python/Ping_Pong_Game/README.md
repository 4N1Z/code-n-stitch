# Motivation
I decided to learn how to code a simple game from a YouTube tutorial during the lockdown. Turns out, it's quie easy with turtle.

# Pre-req
Enthusiasm and a basic understanding of physics I suppose!

# Ping-Pong-Game
Instructions to play the game:

  1. Download the bounce.wav file
  2. Make sure it is in the same folder as of pingpong.py
  3. Make relevant changes in the audio code as per your OS
  4. Run pingpong.py on your local device
  5. Use "w" and "s" key to navigate the left paddle
  6. Use "Up" and "Down" key to navigate the right paddle
  
Enjoy
