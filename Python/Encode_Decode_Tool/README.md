# Encrpytion Tool
A basic CLI Python based tool for encrypting and decrypting multiple famous algorithms and cipher such as: 
* Base64
* Morse
* Caesar Cipher
* Hex

## Features:
- [x] Morse encode and decode

- [x] Base64 encode and deocde

- [x] Hex encode and deocde

- [x] Caesar Cipher Encode and decode
- [ ] Binary Encode and decode (to be added).

## Required Dependencies:
Install everything using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

OR

* Base64, It's always better to check that you actually have that installed using: 
```bash
python -m pip install base64
```
* Binascii, I am not quite sure if it comes with stock python so run this command:
```bash
python -m pip install binascii
```
* Morse3, DOESN'T come with stock python, Install it using:
```bash
python -m pip install morse3
```

## Required Python Version:
This was built using Python 3.8.3, It's recommended to use the same version, but you can use anything higher than 3.6 and lower than 3.9 (I haven't tested it yet on 3.9)

## Usage:
After you installed everything required, Run the following command:
```bash 
python enc.py
```
And follow the instructions.
