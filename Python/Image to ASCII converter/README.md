# What does it do?
- It takes in path to an image and returns an ascii version of the image which can then be printed and copy-pasted
# Instructions
- Pass in the path to image file as parameter to `convert()` function
- Optionally tweak the `width` and `threshold value` (Default value for both variables is `100`) to get a nicer ascii version of the image.
